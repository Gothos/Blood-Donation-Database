# Blood-Donation-Database
This project contains a basic database management system for a blood donation camp. To set up the database , run the Blood_Donation.sql file via MySQL.
To run the project, run the db.ipynb file in the "public" folder with an IDE that supports the execution of Jupyter notebooks. 
The webpage will be hosted locally. Go to the webpage http://127.0.0.1:4004/home to access the homepage. Please note that the port number for the webpage
is set to 4004 by default, and can be changed by changing the port="" part of the last line of the .ipynb file. After stopping execution, it is necessary to change the port number to reaccess the project. To access the webpage when using a different port, use the link http://127.0.0.1:(port no)/home where (port no) is replaced by the current port number.
The admin page can be accessed by logging in on the login page with the Aadhaar ID admintoor1234 and password admin1234.
